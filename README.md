## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology

### Continued development

Handling the stacking context still feels like a pain in the butt. I'm finally developing brain muscle with Grid layouts, which feels nice.

I still can't quite understand well why setting 100% to height in body, doesn't inherit from HTML as expected, need to read more about this.

### Useful resources

- [Complete guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - CSS-Tricks never fails, I'll keep linking this everytime I use it!
- [Inner workings of the stacking context](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54897916/why-cant-an-element-with-a-z-index-value-cover-its-child) - Still haven't fully mastered stacking contexts, extremely important to understand painting order.
